                <p>The same way we don't do generic training? We don't do generic results. With our Small Group Personal
                    Training, we customise your programming and nutrition approach so that your progress will be based
                    off your goals.
                    <br><br>
                    We've had clients boast about dropping dress sizes, fitting into suit jackets they haven't even
                    attempted since before they got married, feeling elated they can keep up with their kids and
                    grandkids, or finally being able to put on muscle after years of frustration.
                    <br><br>
                    It's not our job as the number one personal trainers in Delhi-NCR to tell you your goal- it's
                    simply our role to get you there (and we're damn good at that part).

                <h3>How is this different from a normal gym exercise class or bootcamp?</h3>
                <p>Your Six Week Transformation Challenge is personal training in a small group environment
                    <br><br>
                    Which means all your training plans are customized and recorded for progression week to week, you
                    get
                    1-2-1 support and nutrition guidance, and your results are regularly monitored to keep you on track

                <h3>Do you give me a strict diet to follow?</h3>
                <p>Our nutrition coaching works off the “teach a person to fish” model, rather than the outdated premise
                    of
                    strict periods of dieting. The fact is, you can drink beer and wine, and enjoy a social life with
                    BBQs
                    and meals out with friends AND get amazing results
                    <br><br>
                    It’s just down to understanding the balance needed to still make progress without being miserable.
                    Our
                    nutrition coaching approach allows us to look at what you’re doing, and make adjustments from there
                    for
                    long-term results without the frustration and bounce back that traditional diets bring

                <h3>I've never lifted weights before, will this be right for me?</h3>
                <p>Lifting weights is the most effective way for you to train for physique improvements, increasing your
                    strength, boosting your joint health, creating a toned & athletic frame, decreasing daily aches and
                    pains and making the most from the time you're investing into training - But it can be intimidating
                    to
                    learn, especially in a normal big commercial gym
                    <br><br>
                    Our Transformation Challenge gives you the perfect environment to learn the ropes the right way,
                    working
                    1-2-1 with an experienced and friendly coach, in an group of men and women that are rooting for each
                    other to win, and have your back every step of the way

                <h3>I've lifted for years, will I gain much from this programme?</h3>
                <p>The greatest athletes in the world have coaches- a network and support term to ensure they make the
                    most
                    of the efforts they're putting in
                    <br><br>
                    Progression is built into the fabric of our small group programming, so your coach will be able to
                    help
                    you navigate and overcome training plateaus in an supportive environment
                    <br><br>
                    Plus training aside, we've seen the most experience lifters results sky-rocket once they made the
                    simple
                    dietary changes that were suggested in their 1-2-1 nutrition session (included as standard, in all
                    transformation packages)

                <h3>How long does it take to see results</h3>
                <p>In terms of outlook and energy? Many of our clients feel the difference after just one week of making
                    their health a priority, noting the drop in afternoon lethargy, and can already feel the impact that
                    positive momentum is having on their body
                    <br><br>
                    It’s generally around that 4-5 week mark however that a solid, physical difference begins to show.
                    Whether it’s a notch or two down on the belt buckle, jeans no longer digging into the stomach, or
                    being
                    able to pick your kids up overhead without shoulder pain or groaning. Another month on from there?
                    And
                    you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve
                </p>

                <h3>How do I know if this is the right fit for me</h3>
                <p>Kamal Fitness was designed from the ground up with one thing in mind- getting men and
                    women
                    to finally achieve their health goals, and allow them to fit fitness back into their lives
                    <br><br>
                    There's a reason we offer a 100% money back guarantee- and that's because the transformation process
                    we
                    follow works, and we want you to feel completely confident you're making the right choice
                    <br><br>
                    Because in 6 weeks time, when your jeans are fitting looser and you're feeling stronger, more
                    energetic
                    and higher in confidence? You'll be very glad that you took action, scrolled up, and applied for
                    your
                    free trial.
