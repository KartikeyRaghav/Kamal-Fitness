        <div class="questions">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Do I need a gym membership?</h3>
                <p>The model of “pay for access to a room full of equipment” that traditional gyms run? Tends to work
                    for about 5% of their members. So to ensure you get the maximum possible results for the time you’re
                    putting in- all of your training sessions at Kamal Fitness will be appointment only, with your
                    Personal Trainer, so no extra membership is required
                    <br><br>
                    This approach allows you the security to know that every time you come to train, you’ll leave that
                    much closer to your goals, with no wasted efforts, AND, that added accountability of booking in a
                    specific time with your coach? Means adherence and therefore results, is head and shoulder above the
                    standard “gym membership” approach
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
                <p>In terms of outlook and energy? Many of our clients feel the difference after just one week of making
                    their health a priority, and note the drop in afternoon lethargy, and can already feel the impact
                    that positive momentum is having on their body
                    <br><br>
                    It’s generally around that 4-5 week mark however that a solid, physical difference begins to show.
                    Whether it’s a notch or two down on the belt buckle, jeans no longer digging into the stomach, or
                    being able to pick your kids up overhead without shoulder pain or groaning. Another month on from
                    there? And you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>I’ve never been to a gym before, will this be right for me?</h3>
                <p>If you’ve never trained before, or only dabbled with the cross-trainers and a few bodypump classes?
                    Personal Training is the perfect way to create a solid foundation for a long term transformation-
                    avoiding the injuries and frustration that most people go through, before throwing in the towel when
                    they don’t have a coach on their side
                    <br><br>
                    Gyms can be big, intimidating places. Our coaches understand that, and have spent many years
                    introducing men and women to fitness the right way- putting their safety and confidence first to
                    ensure they fall in love with fitness, and make it a lifelong commitment to health, rather than a
                    short term fling

            <div class="card">
                <h3>I’ve been training for years, will you be able to help me get to the next level?</h3>
                <p>All great athletes have coaches, from Olympians to Hollywood Stars prepping for a role involving
                    walking out of the sea in slow-motion. Our coaches stay on top of the latest research and training
                    modalities to ensure we’re always providing the most up to date methods for getting men and women in
                    the best shape of their life
                    <br><br>
                    Even if you’ve been deadlifting since you were 6, and want a team to get behind you and take your to
                    the next level? Our Personal Training will give you the guidance, tools and support to break through
                    any plateaus and progress even further in your health and fitness journey

                <h3>Do you give me a strict diet to follow?</h3>
                <p>Our nutrition coaching works off the “teach a person to fish” model, rather than the outdated premise
                    of strict periods of dieting. The fact is, you can drink beer and wine, and enjoy a social life with
                    BBQs and meals out with friends AND get amazing results
                    <br><br>
                    It’s just down to understanding the balance needed to still make progress without being miserable.
                    Our nutrition coaching approach allows us to look at what you’re current doing, and make adjustments
                    from there for long-term results without the frustration and bounce back that traditional diets
                    bring

                <h3>How do I know if this is the right fit for me?</h3>
                <p>Kamal Fitness was built after over a decade of coaching with a simple mission- to give men and women
                    every single tool they’ll need to get incredible results, and remove their frustrations with health,
                    fitness, and their own limitations
                    <br><br>
                    Honestly, the fitness industry has a lot of flaws. Empty promises, sticky, long term contracts,
                    over-hyped supplements and gyms that care more about revenue than results. Our entire business
                    model? Is to get you incredible results, so that you tell your friends and family, and we get to
                    help even more people. We don’t do empty promises, hard-selling, supplement pushing or sticky, long
                    term contracts. We do Results.
