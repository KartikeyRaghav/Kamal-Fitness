                <h3>How does a Nutrition Coaching Transformation Start?</h3>
                <p>Each nutrition coaching transformation starts with an in-depth chat with your coach, where they
                    pin-point exactly where you’re currently at, where you want to get to, and what’s standing in the
                    way. This first session is about getting to know you, and ensuring the approach we take together
                    creates long-term change, rather than a quick yo-yo effect.

            <div class="card">
                <h3>How much time do I need to dedicate to the program?</h3>
                <p>Your Nutrition Transformation Programme is 6 weeks in length, with the option to continue afterwards
                    if needed (the goal is to make sure after your programme however, you not only get amazing results,
                    but never need to “diet” again).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How is this different from slimming world, Weight Watchers etc?</h3>
                <p>Nutrition Coaching at the Armoury isn’t about telling you what to it. These approaches that give
                    points to food items, and restrict your eating lead to bouncing up and down in weight, and leave you
                    in the dark with how to eat for long-term success.
                    <br><br>
                    Our approach allows you to still eat the foods you love, and get the results you want- without
                    bouncing back. Our coaching is 1-2-1 because your situation is unique, and we believe it deserves
                    that attention. Alongside your bespoke habit & nutrition coaching you’ll also have access to a
                    complete membership site for even more knowledge
                    <br><br>
                    (in fact, access to this information alone gives you to power to never be confused with fad diets
                    again)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How fast can I see results?</h3>
                <p>We could make bold claims like "you’ll drop 20lbs in 6 weeks" (if we asked you to eat salads and dust
                    for every meal)- but that would lead to a yo-yo effect and hating us as studio
                    <br><br>
                    instead, the approach we take? Is for long-term progress. Sure, we've had 15-odd pounds lost in the
                    6 weeks, but that’s not always the goal.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone’s “wins” are different- for some people it’s losing 2 inches off their waist- for others
                    it may be not feeling guilty when enjoying a slice of cake, and not feeling the need to always be
                    extreme with an on/off diet mentality.
                    <br><br>
                    Fast isn’t the goal- sustainability is.
