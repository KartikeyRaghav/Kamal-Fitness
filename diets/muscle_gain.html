            <p class="mission">Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of
                actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and
                the shape of the cell. To gain your muscles you have to follow a healthy or best diet plandiet.
                <br><br>
                Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more calories than the average person of the same weight to
                provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. A
                sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with cardiovascular exercise to lose body fat in
                preparation for a contest.
                <br><br>
                The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the
                bodybuilder. Carbohydrates play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal
                with the rigors of training and recovery.
                <br><br>
                Proteins are the building block of muscles, so it is essential to consume an adequate amount of protein.
                Animal protein has high biological value than plant protein, so protein from animal sources is preferred
                over protein from plant sources. Apart from these include all different fruits and vegetables to get
                vitamins and minerals.
                <br><br>
                To build a bigger and leaner physique, bodybuilders and average guys alike often turn to the same
                strategy: eating everything in sight, or “bulking,” and then burning fat, or “cutting,” by reducing
                calories and eating cleaner to reveal the new muscle beneath. It works, but it takes time and can cause
                you long-term damage on a cellular level—and it can make it very hard to stay lean over the long term.
