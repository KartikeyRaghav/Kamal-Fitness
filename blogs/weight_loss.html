            <p class="mission">Are you looking for the best Indian Diet Plan to lose weight? The rules are
                simple.<br><br>All you
                need
                to do is start eating right food. However, in India, this can feel like an insurmountable challenge,
                given
                our
                food culture and dietary habits. For instance, a typical Indian meal is high in carbohydrates and sugar
                – we
                eat
                a lot of potatoes, rice, and sweets.<br><br>We also love our snacks and can’t imagine a day without our
                fix of
                namkeens and bhujias. Even we encourage our friends and family into eating more, as a sign of
                hospitality
                and
                affection, and consider refusing, an extra helping a rebuff. To top it all, we’ve never embraced
                physical
                exercise as essential. So, it isn’t a surprise that India is battling with a growing problem of
                obesity.<br><br>But, the answer doesn’t lie in shunning Indian food in favour of foreign ingredients or
                fad diets. Moreover, you’ll find that the best Indian diet plan consists of foods that you’ve already
                got in your kitchen and which will enable you to lose weight by making a few changes to your diet.</p>

                <h2>01</h2>
                <p>
                    Weight loss and gain revolve around caloric consumption and expenditure. Simply put, you lose weight
                    when you consume fewer calories than you expend and you gain weight when you consume more calories
                    than you sweat.
                    <br><br>
                    To drop those extra kilos, all you need to do is eat within your calorie budget and burn the
                    required number of calories. So, a combination of the two works best suggested experts.
                    <br><br>
                    However, simply determining how many calories your body needs isn’t enough. After all, four samosas
                    (600 calories), two slices of pizza (500 calories), and two gulab jamuns (385 calories) may be
                    within your daily requirement of 1500 calories, but these unhealthy food choices will eventually
                    lead to other health problems like high cholesterol and blood sugar.
                    <br><br>
                    To lose weight the healthy way, you also need to ensure your Indian diet plan is balanced i.e. it
                    covers all food groups and provides all the nutrients you need necessary for good health.

                <h3 class="heading">The Best Diet Plan for Weight Loss</h3>
                <h2>02</h2>
                <p>No single food provides all the calories and nutrients that the body needs to stay healthy. That’s
                    why a balanced diet consisting of macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fat along with
                    micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, is recommended.
                    <br><br>
                    The best Indian diet for weight loss is a combination of the five major food groups – fruits and
                    vegetables, cereals and pulses, meat and dairy products, and fats and oils. Furthermore, knowing how
                    to divvy up the food groups, allocate portion sizes, and the best/ideal time to eat is also equally
                    important.

                <h2>03</h2>
                <p>While creating a diet chart, it is important to make sure it is balanced and ensures that you receive
                    all the required nutrients. Thus, include the following nutrients in your diet plan:</p>
                <div class="diet-card">
                    <h3>Carbohydrates Diet Plan</h3>
                    <p>Carbs are the body’s main source of energy and should make up half of your daily calorie
                        requirement. However, it’s important to choose the right type of carbs. Simple carbs, such as
                        bread, biscuit, white rice and wheat flour, contain too much sugar and are bad for you.
                        <br><br>
                        Instead, opt for complex carbs that are high in fiber and packed with nutrients as compared to
                        simple carbs. This is because Fiber-rich complex carbs are harder to digest, leaving you feeling
                        full for longer, and are therefore the best option for weight control.
                        <br><br>
                        Brown rice, millets such as ragi and oats are all good complex carb choices.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="diet-card">
                    <h3>Proteins Diet Plan</h3>
                    <p>Most Indians fail to meet their daily protein requirement. This is troublesome, as proteins are
                        essential to help the body build and repair tissue, muscles, cartilage and skin, as well as pump
                        blood. Hence. a high protein diet can also help you lose weight, as it helps build muscle –
                        which burns more calories than fat.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, about 30% of your diet should consist of protein in the form of whole dals,
                        paneer, chana, milk, leafy greens, eggs, white meat or sprouts. Having one helping of protein
                        with every meal is essential.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="diet-card">
                    <h3>Fats Diet Plan</h3>
                    <p>A food group that has acquired a bad reputation, fats are essential for the body as they
                        synthesize hormones, store vitamins and provide energy. Experts suggest one-fifth or 20% of your
                        diet must consist of healthy fats – polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and Omega-3 fatty acids.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, using a combination of oils for different meals – including olive oil, rice bran
                        oil, mustard oil, soya bean, sesame, sunflower and groundnut oil – along with restricted
                        quantities of butter and ghee is the most optimal way to consume fats. But, you must avoid trans
                        fats – that are found in fried snacks, completely for a balanced Indian Diet Plan.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="diet-card">
                    <h3>Vitamins and Minerals Diet Plan</h3>
                    <p>Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, calcium and iron are essential for the body as they
                        support metabolism, nerve and muscle function, bone maintenance, and cell production. Since,
                        these are primarily derived from plants, meat and fish, minerals can also be found in nuts,
                        oilseeds, fruits and green leafy vegetables.
                        <br><br>
                        Experts and nutritionists recommend consuming 100 grams of greens and 100 grams of fruits
                        accordingly.

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Opt for 5-6 meals a day:</span> Instead of three large meals, try having three modest
                        meals and a few snack breaks in controlled portions for the day. Spacing your meals across
                        regular intervals prevents acidity and bloating and also keeps hunger pangs at bay. So, quit
                        your junk food habit by making healthier snacking choices in your indian diet plan.</li>
                    <li><span>Have an early dinner:</span> Indians eat dinner later than the other societies across the
                        world. Since metabolism slows down at night, a late dinner can lead to weight gain. Experts
                        recommend you eat your last meal of the day by 8 pm.</li>
                    <li><span>Drink a lot of water:</span> How does drinking more water help you lose weight? For
                        starters, it’s zero calories. Also, drinking a glass of water can help curb hunger pangs. Have
                        six to eight glasses of water daily to lose weight.</li>
                    <li><span>Eat a lot of fiber:</span> A person needs at least 15 gm of fiber every day, as it aids
                        digestion and heart health. Oats, lentils, flax seeds, apples and broccoli are some great
                        sources of fiber.</li>
